# Topic: Unstable

NAMES: "Ustables", "Ustable squad", "Les Ustables"

- RL darkest dungeon inspired combat game, where your heroes are unstable and have this as their ability bar, when they turn fully unstable they gain new abilities which are very powerful.

- Without being unstable they'll have just very simple attacks and abilities.

- HEROES: All the heroes should be in some way unstable - crazy, werewolf, joker...

- MAP: There will be only option to go right, there will be shops and upgrade stations

- GOAL: Escape the psych ward (through the canals) 



Add traps (something falling from the ceiling) or someone slipping into the water
